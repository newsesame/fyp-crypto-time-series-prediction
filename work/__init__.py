"""Bitcoin Price Prediction Using Transformers

This package provides a comprehensive framework for Bitcoin price prediction
using both Transformer and GRU neural network architectures. It includes
modules for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Main components:
- config: Configuration and hyperparameters
- data_loader: Data loading and preprocessing utilities
- features: Feature engineering with technical indicators
- models: Neural network model definitions
- regression: Regression task implementation
- classification: Classification task implementation
- compat: Compatibility utilities

The package supports both regression (price prediction) and classification
(price direction prediction) tasks with comprehensive evaluation metrics.
